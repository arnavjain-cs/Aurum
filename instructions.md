2. Plan Phase 1 — /gsd:plan-phase 1 (creates detailed plan for simulation engine)
3. Review the plan — Understand what needs building
4. Execute — /gsd:execute-phase 1 (AI builds the code with atomic commits)
5. Verify — /gsd:verify-work (confirm it meets phase goals)
6. Move to Phase 2 — Once Phase 1 is done
